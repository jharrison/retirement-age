<h2>Retirement Age Model</h2> 
Originally by R. Axtell and J. Epstein.
Replicated by Ernesto Carrella and Joseph Harrison
</table>

<p>This model simulates the retirement decisions of a heterogeneous population of agents.
<ul>
<li>Rational agents retire as soon as they are allowed to.
<li>Imitator agents retire when a high proportion of their social network has retired.
<li>Random agents flip a coin each year.
</ul>
